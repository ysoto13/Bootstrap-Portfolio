Full-Stack Web Developer

Graduated from University of Central Florida's Boot Camp for Coding by Triology.

I want to be able to work in the web development field because I have the passion in creating websites.

I am organized, team oriented, and have a passion for my work.

I currently work as a Designated Hitter at Walgreens. When I work at Walgreens I work through out different departments of the store, including Pharmacy. They give me managerial duties when the upper management is busy with other tasks.
